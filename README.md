The main object in this program is a car. The four components that are part of the car are brake, door, engine and accelerator. For the accelerator to work, car's engine has to be turned on. When accelerator is pushed, speed gets increased by 5. When brake is pushed, speed decreases by 5 unless it is less than 5 in which case speed becomes 0. Also, the program checks if the doors are open or closed.# Class_Interaction
